# Sensors And Actuators

This repository is a well-organized collection of sensors and actuators modules for embedded and robotics projects. Each sensor or actuator folder is structured to include comprehensive hardware documentation and practical code examples, enabling seamless development and learning.

Each module folder contains:

- `datasheet.pdf` providing technical specifications
- `pinout.png` detailing hardware connections
- `circuit_diagram.png` illustrating wiring and schematics
- An `Arduino_Code/` directory housing Arduino sketches named `example.ino` to demonstrate usage

Explore the folders to find detailed reference materials alongside ready-to-use Arduino code samples tailored to each sensor or actuator, facilitating streamlined experimentation and prototyping.
